## Virtual Environments and Requirements

Virtual environments keep your project dependencies separate from your system Python.

### Setup Steps

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv netmiko-env

# Activate it
# Windows:
netmiko-env\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source netmiko-env/bin/activate
```

**Key packages:**

- `netmiko` - SSH to network devices  
- `ntc-templates` - Parse command output
- `PyYAML` - Work with YAML files

**Practice:** Set up your environment and verify netmiko imports successfully.

## Introduction to Netmiko

Netmiko is a Python library that simplifies SSH connections to network devices.

### Basic Import and Connection

```python
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

device = {
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
    'host': '192.168.1.1',
    'username': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password'
}

connection = ConnectHandler(**device)
```

**Practice:** Import netmiko and create a device dictionary for your lab device.

---

## Using help(), dir(), and inspect()

Before diving deeper into netmiko, learn to explore Python objects yourself.

### Essential Exploration Tools

```python
import netmiko
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# See all available methods
print(dir(ConnectHandler))

# Get detailed help
help(ConnectHandler.send_command)

# Find methods with 'send' in the name
methods = [m for m in dir(ConnectHandler) if 'send' in m]
print(methods)
```

**Practice:** Use `help()` to explore `ConnectHandler.send_command()` and find what exceptions it might raise.

---

## Basic Connection with getpass

Never hardcode passwords! Use `getpass` for secure credential input.

### Secure Connection Example

```python
import getpass
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

# Get credentials securely
host = input("Device IP: ")
username = input("Username: ")
password = getpass.getpass("Password: ")

device = {
    'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
    'host': host,
    'username': username,
    'password': password
}

connection = ConnectHandler(**device)
print("Connected!")
connection.disconnect()
```

**Practice:** Create a connection script using getpass. Test it with your lab device.

---

## Show Commands and Raw Output

Let's see what raw output looks like and why we need to format it.

### Your First Commands

```python
# After connecting...
output = connection.send_command('show version')
print(output)  # This is raw output - messy!

# Try these too
print(connection.send_command('show ip interface brief'))
```

Notice how the raw output is hard to read? That's why we need formatting tools.

**Practice:** Run several show commands and observe the raw output format.

---

## Pretty Printing Output

Now let's make that output readable!

### Using pprint

```python
from pprint import pprint

# For better formatting
output = connection.send_command('show version')
print("="*50)
print("FORMATTED OUTPUT")
print("="*50)
print(output)
```

**Practice:** Format the output of multiple show commands for better readability

---

## Configuration Commands

Configuration commands modify device settings. Handle with care!

### Basic Config Example

```python
# Single command
config_commands = ['interface loopback 100', 'ip address 100.100.100.100 255.255.255.255']
output = connection.send_config_set(config_commands)
print(output)
```

**Practice:** Configure a loopback interface on your lab device.

---

## Working with Multiple Devices

Scale your automation by working with device lists.

### Multiple Device Example

```python
devices = [
    {'host': '192.168.1.1', 'username': 'admin', 'password': 'pass1'},
    {'host': '192.168.1.2', 'username': 'admin', 'password': 'pass2'}
]

for device in devices:
    device['device_type'] = 'cisco_ios'
    conn = ConnectHandler(**device)
    output = conn.send_command('show version')
    print(f"Device {device['host']}: {output[:50]}...")
    conn.disconnect()
```

**Practice:** Create a device list and gather version info from each.

---

## Parsing with TextFSM and NTC-Templates

Raw text is hard to work with. Let's structure it!

### Why Parse Output?

Look at your raw `show version` output - it's just text. But what if you could get structured data instead?

### Using NTC-Templates

```python
from ntc_templates.parse import parse_output

# Get structured data instead of raw text
output = connection.send_command('show version')
parsed = parse_output(platform='cisco_ios', command='show version', data=output)

# Now you have a list of dictionaries!
print(parsed[0]['hostname'])
print(parsed[0]['version'])
```

**Practice:** Parse `show ip interface brief` and extract just the interface names.

---

## F-Strings and Basic Reports

Create professional output and save results to files.

### Formatting with F-Strings

```python
hostname = parsed[0]['hostname']
version = parsed[0]['version']
uptime = parsed[0]['uptime']

report = f"""
Device Report
=============
Hostname: {hostname}
Version:  {version}
Uptime:   {uptime}
"""

print(report)

# Save to file
with open(f'{hostname}_report.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(report)
```

**Practice:** Create a device inventory report and save it to a file.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Timeouts** - Check network connectivity and device IP
2. **Authentication Failures** - Verify username/password and enable secret
3. **Command Failures** - Ensure commands are valid for the device type
4. **Parsing Errors** - Check output format and adjust parsing logic

### Debug Tips

- Use `session_log` parameter to capture all interactions
- Print raw output to understand format
- Test commands manually on device first
- Use try/except blocks for error handling
