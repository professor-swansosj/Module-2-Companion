# 07: Professional Reports with F-Strings

## Why This Matters

Data without presentation is just numbers. Professional reports communicate results clearly to management, document network state for compliance, and create actionable information from raw data. F-strings make creating polished output efficient and maintainable.

## Key Terms

- **F-strings** - Modern Python string formatting with embedded expressions
- **String interpolation** - Inserting variable values into string templates
- **Number formatting** - Controlling decimal places, padding, alignment
- **Template reporting** - Reusable report formats with variable data
- **File output** - Saving reports for documentation and sharing

## The Power of Professional Presentation

Compare these approaches to showing device information:

**Amateurish:**

```bash
Router1 15.2(4)S7 127 days 23.7
```

**Professional:**

```bash
DEVICE REPORT - Generated 2025-10-28 14:30:15
=============================================
Hostname: Router1
Version:  15.2(4)S7  
Uptime:   127 days, 14 hours
CPU:      23.7%
=============================================
```

Which would you rather include in a management presentation?

## Try It

Complete the TODO items in `device_reports.py`:

1. Create formatted device inventory reports using f-strings
2. Add professional headers, alignment, and number formatting
3. Save reports to timestamped files for documentation
4. Build a multi-device summary report
5. **Challenge**: Create an HTML report with basic styling

## Check Yourself

1. What advantages do f-strings have over older formatting methods?
2. How do you control number formatting (decimals, padding)?
3. What's the benefit of timestamping reports?
4. How can reports be used for compliance documentation?
5. Why is consistent formatting important in professional reports?
