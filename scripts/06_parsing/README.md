# ðŸ“Š Module 2.6: Parsing with TextFSM and NTC-Templates

## What You'll Learn

- Why structured data beats raw text  
- Use NTC-Templates for common commands
- Parse output into dictionaries and lists
- Extract specific information programmatically

## Why This Matters

Remember that messy raw output? Now turn it into clean, structured data you can actually use!

## Your Mission ðŸŽ¯

Complete the starter code to:

1. Parse `show version` with NTC-Templates
2. Extract hostname and version automatically  
3. Parse `show ip interface brief` into a list
4. Compare parsed vs raw data

## Starter Files

- `basic_parsing.py` - Learn NTC-Templates basics
- `structured_data.py` - Work with parsed dictionaries

## Success Criteria âœ…

- [ ] Successfully parses show version
- [ ] Extracts hostname and version programmatically
- [ ] Converts interface output to structured data
- [ ] Understands the power of structured data

## Common Parseable Commands ðŸ“‹

- `show version` - Device information
- `show ip interface brief` - Interface status
- `show ip route` - Routing table  
- `show interfaces` - Detailed interface info

## Next Steps

With parsing skills, you're ready to create professional reports with f-strings!
