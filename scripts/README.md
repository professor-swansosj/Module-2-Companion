### 🔍 01_exploration
Learn to use `help()`, `dir()`, and `inspect()` to explore Netmiko like a pro!

### 🔐 02_secure_connection  
Master secure credential handling with `getpass` - never hardcode passwords again!

## How to Use These Scripts

1. **Start with the README** in each directory
2. **Complete the TODOs** in the starter scripts  
3. **Run and test** your code
4. **Build on each success** to reach the next level

## Remember: Learning by Doing! 🚀

These scripts have TODOs and hints - NOT complete solutions. You need to:
- ✅ Read the code and understand it
- ✅ Complete the missing parts  
- ✅ Test with your lab devices
- ✅ Experiment and make mistakes
- ✅ Build your skills progressively

## Need Help?
- Use `help()` and `dir()` on any object
- Check the Netmiko documentation  
- Ask your instructor
- Work with classmates
- Most importantly: **try things**!

**Happy automating!** 🎉
