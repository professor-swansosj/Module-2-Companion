# ðŸ“º Module 2.3: Show Commands and Raw Output

## What You'll Learn

- Execute basic show commands
- See what "raw output" looks like and why it's messy
- Understand the need for output formatting
- Run multiple commands efficiently

## Why This Matters

Raw command output is hard to read and process. You need to see the problem before learning the solution!

## Your Mission ðŸŽ¯

Complete the starter code to:

1. Execute basic show commands
2. Observe raw output formatting issues
3. Compare different command outputs
4. Save raw output to files for analysis

## Common Show Commands to Try ðŸ“‹

- `show version` - Device info and OS version
- `show ip interface brief` - Interface summary
- `show running-config` - Current configuration
- `show ip route` - Routing table
- `show clock` - System time

## Starter Files

- `basic_show_commands.py` - Execute and observe show commands
- `raw_output_analysis.py` - Analyze formatting challenges

## Success Criteria âœ…

- [ ] Successfully runs multiple show commands
- [ ] Saves raw output to text files
- [ ] Identifies formatting challenges
- [ ] Ready to learn about output formatting

## Observation Questions ðŸ¤”

- How many `\n` characters do you see?
- What makes the output hard to parse?
- Which commands produce the messiest output?
- How would you extract specific information?

## Next Steps

Once you see how messy raw output is, you'll appreciate pretty printing and parsing!
