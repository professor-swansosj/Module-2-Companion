# üîç Module 2.1: Exploring Objects with help(), dir(), and inspect()

## What You'll Learn

- Use `dir()` to discover what methods are available
- Use `help()` to read documentation 
- Use `inspect` to understand method signatures
- Apply these skills to explore Netmiko

## Why This Matters

Before you can use any Python library effectively, you need to know how to explore it! These built-in tools are your best friends for learning new code.

## Your Mission üéØ

Complete the starter code in `explore_netmiko.py` to:

1. List all methods in ConnectHandler
2. Get help documentation for send_command
3. Find all methods with 'send' in their name
4. Discover what exceptions Netmiko can raise

## Starter Files

- `explore_netmiko.py` - Your exploration playground
- `find_exceptions.py` - Hunt for Netmiko exceptions

## Success Criteria ‚úÖ

- [ ] Can list ConnectHandler methods
- [ ] Know how to get help on any method
- [ ] Found at least 3 different 'send' methods
- [ ] Discovered common Netmiko exceptions

## Next Steps

Once you can explore objects, you'll be ready to make your first connection!
