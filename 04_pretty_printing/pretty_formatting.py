    # Connect to your device and get 'show version' output
    # Save the messy raw output to compare later
    
    # TODO 3: Create basic formatting functions
    # Make a function that adds headers and separators
    # Make the output look professional with borders
    
    # TODO 4: Practice with structured data
    # Create a dictionary with device information
    # Use pprint() to format it nicely
    
    # TODO 5: Format interface data as a table
    # Take 'show ip interface brief' output
    # Try to make it look like a clean table
    
    # TODO 6: Compare before and after
    # Show the raw output next to your formatted version
    # See the difference good formatting makes!
